In this project, I have applied supervised machine learning techniques to classify low-volatility and high-volatility regimes in the Polish WIG20 stock index.
The goal was to engineer meaningful volatility-based features, label market regimes using a transparent rule, and compare several ML models to determine which best identifies high-volatility periods.
The dataset used in this project is based on historical price data from the WIG20 index, which tracks the 20 largest companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE). The data consists of daily closing prices and was obtained from publicly accessible financial market sources that provide historical index data for research and educational purposes. All transformations—including log returns, rolling volatility measures, and regime labels—were computed directly within the notebook.
