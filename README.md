In this project, I have applied supervised machine learning techniques to classify low-volatility and high-volatility regimes in the Polish WIG20 stock index.
The goal was to engineer meaningful volatility-based features, label market regimes using a transparent rule, and compare several ML models to determine which best identifies high-volatility periods.
